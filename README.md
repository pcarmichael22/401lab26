Intro To React - Lab 26 - Peter Carmichael

- Modularize and Refactor
- Refactor the application given by first modularizing it, and then altering it’s basic functionality of generating a random number into a proper counter application that tracks a number based on button clicks.
- Move the Header and Footer components to separate files
- Properly export them as defaults
- Import them into the App Component using ES6 import statement
- Convert the Header component to an ES6 Class
- Rename the Main component to Counter and render it properly
- Change the state declaration to track a counter instead of stuff
- Change the button handler to increment the counter instead of returning a random number.
- Add a second button that, when clicked, would decrement the counter
- Design Implementation
- Create a file called app.scss and import that into the App component
- Add some creative styling for the header, making use of SASS nesting
- Alter the app.scss as follows:
- Alter your css rules to use a variable (i.e. $backgroundColor)
- Start getting creative about styling the basic layout of the app
- Might things change visually when the counter is > 0 or < 0?
- Where would the buttons look best?
- Can you make the number “pop”

I used tailwindCSS for this lab. I think thats the future of CSS so I will most likely be using it for every lab from this point on.
